    <h4>Welcome to my pet project!</h4>
    Purpose of this site is to give user a nice opportunity to filter database and find right film to right moment. 
    Here you can easilly search film about London or Paris, or you can find scary film about Rachel.
    For me,  personaly is important to cut off something, I don't like, or is not best choise for this evening. For example, 
    I might want to see comedy, but not drama or cartoon, or one from 19xx-s with rating 3.1 . Also I might search
    for horror, but not a thriller or anime . So, you are welcome to try yourself ;) 




    <h4 class="mt-2">Technical tips</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>List of films with cast, year, rating is parsed from IMDB site. Images are parsed from Amazon site, using link from
            IMDB. After that, plots are parsed from Wikipedia. Plots from wiki are usefull, because they describe everything very literally, 
            so it gives us opportunity to search names, places , etc from plots.  View readme.txt in parser folder for details.
            Parsed data can be applied to site from profile page of any admin account. Also admins have acces to form, which is
            used to add film manually
        </li>
        <li>List of all tags, genres and countries, that are used in existing db are cashed from button, accessed from main menu of any admin account</li>
        <li>Base is not including all films possible, so as not to be to heavy. It includes films with higher rating, and does not include
            bigger part of old films</li>
        <li>After you change filters and go to another page, page reminds fields 'search', 'country', 'year', 'rating' and loses 
            all tags and genres. It makes easier to clear query if nothing is found, and economies many lines of code </li>
        <li>Database is built on PostgreSQL, and use its HStore and ArrayField . Current project does not use external models for actors,
            directors and additional images and video, because parsed data is not accurate and it can bring chaos to the project, but it 
            can be changed in the future   </li>
        <li>Rating, token from IMDB for default = 20votes. After all ratings of Filmbrary applied. Score are stored in account, and if user
            changes score old score is deleted and system recounts total rating. Film model stores only number of votes and averge rating,
             as it is not commercial project and it is not mean't to be too complicated
        </li>
        <li>
            Bootstrap is used for styling of everything. It does most of job, so css file is not to big
        </li>
        <li> 
            Lots of thanks to creators of "Highly-Customizable-Range-Slider-Plugin-For-Bootstrap-Bootstrap-Slider".It is used
            for choosing rating, years in filters. Special modified version ( which took me several days of exploring its css features)
            is aplied to rating in detailed page. It has its own library where every single file of css and js is modified and all
            names and classes are renamed not to collide with filters slider library
        </li>
    </ol>
